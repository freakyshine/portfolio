# My Portfolio
The portfolio should give an insight to what I've already accomplished or what I am working on.
It should be visually appealing and accessible over [this URL](daniel.lutz.is).

## Development
The page's source code is atomically structured. It consists of components of which pages are built up with.
To run up a local development environment run
```npm run start```
To run up a network-wide development environment run _(suggested: only private networks on windows)_
```npm run dev```
